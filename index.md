## Motivation of the visualization

I choose the ‘Times World University Ranking (2011-2016)’ dataset as my final project of 590 DVO due to my own interest. As an international student, I understand that decide a school list is the primary thing of the whole grad school application process. Because of this, students usually consider some standard for helping them make a better decision, and one of the most popular approaches is university ranking, and I would like to know more about the details, including any kind of data-based comparison and visualization.
  
Among the dataset, there are 14 columns and 2064 rows of the data. The columns represent categorized information that is used to calculate the ranking including World ranking, name of the university, teaching rating, outlook rating, research rating, citation rating, industry income rating, total score, total score, num of students, student/stuff/ratio, %of inter-student, % of female student, and year. In this dataset, most of the columns are represented by numbers that are either quantifiable or continuous. In addition, a few columns like University and Country are presented by word-based text.
